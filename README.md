# Business-Insight-360

Power BI Dashboard Project | Advanced DAX Implementation 

Thrilled to share my latest end-to-end Power BI project, where I designed and developed a fully interactive and dynamic business intelligence solution for performance analysis.

✨ Key Highlights of the Project:

📊 Dynamic Dashboarding: Multi-level drill-down across region, market, customer, and product segment.

⚡ Advanced DAX Measures: Built complex measures for YoY growth, net error, forecast accuracy, profit/loss KPIs, and unit economics.

🔍 Comprehensive Analysis: Profit & Loss statement, product performance, customer insights, and forecast accuracy trends — all in one ecosystem.

🎯 Strategic KPIs:
Net Sales: $1.02Bn
GM%: 37.78%
Net Profit %: -14.26%
Forecast Accuracy: 39.43%

📌 The dashboards are not only visually appealing, but also designed to empower decision-makers with actionable insights such as:
 ✔️ Identifying top & bottom-performing products and regions
 ✔️ Understanding cost breakdowns and unit economics
 ✔️ Tracking forecast accuracy and inventory risks

💡 This project demonstrates how data storytelling, advanced DAX, and professional dashboard design can combine to deliver high-impact business intelligence solutions.
